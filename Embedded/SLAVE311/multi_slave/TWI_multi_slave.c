* Supported devices : All devices with a TWI module the has a slave address mask
*                     register. The example is written for the ATmega48.

* AppNote           : AVR311 - TWI Slave Implementation
*
* Description       : This is sample driver to AVRs TWI module. 
*                     It is interupt driveren. All functionality is controlled through 
*                     passing information to and from functions. Se main.c for samples
*                     of how to use the driver.
