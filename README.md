# KAUSat-5-Sensor-Sim
MATLAB/Embedded C software for the ADCS sensor simulator for KAUSAT-5, a 3U CubeSat developed at Korea Aerospace University's Space Systems Research Laboratory. This was the main work of my 2014-2015 Fulbright grant to South Korea. The complete system was capable of delivering real-time simulated sensor data from the MATLAB-STK interface via ATMega128 to KAUSAT-5's ADCS board for on-the-ground debugging purposes.  Simulated sensors included 5x sun, x-y-x mag, and x-y-z gyro. Data transfer protocols included UART, SPI, I2C
